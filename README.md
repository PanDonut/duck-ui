## Easily create good-looking UIs
### Getting started
Use `npm install duck-ui` to start using this package
### Usage
There are many pre-made UI elements that you can use.
#### There is no more info `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` except for one...
When you use VS Code you have all the elements visible with descriptions and usage. You can also check out [docs](https://github.com/PanDonut/duck-ui/wiki).
